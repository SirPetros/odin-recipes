            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Kourabiedes</strong>, though originally from Turkey, are regardless an amazing 
                Greek dessert. Some overly proud Greeks may scoff at praise of an originally 
                Turkish dessert, or deny their Turkish origins entirely, but this author pays 
                those sentiments little mind. The tastebuds care little for the little cookies' 
                origins when they are brought to life by buttery and almondy deliciousness.

                This receipe is fairly straightforward: make dough with <em>lots</em> of butter
                and crushed almonds, bake, and cover in powdered sugar. I could go in to more detail,
                perhaps at a later time.
